/* Nesting
When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 
Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice. */
