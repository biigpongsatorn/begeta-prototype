/* 
Mixins

Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. 
A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. 
You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. */
